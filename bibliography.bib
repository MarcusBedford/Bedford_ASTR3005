@article{Nissen2010,
	abstract = {{<BR /> Aims: Precise abundance ratios are determined for 94 dwarf stars
with T$_{eff}$ K, -1.6 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ -0.4, and distances D
{\lap} 335 pc. Most of them have halo kinematics, but 16 thick-disk stars
are included. <BR /> Methods: Equivalent widths of atomic lines are
measured from VLT/UVES and NOT/FIES spectra with resolutions R{\sime} 55
000 and R {\sime} 40 000, respectively. An LTE abundance analysis based
on MARCS models is applied to derive precise differential abundance
ratios of Na, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Ni with respect to Fe. <BR />
Results: The halo stars fall into two populations, clearly separated in
[{$\alpha$}/Fe], where {$\alpha$} refers to the average abundance of Mg, Si,
Ca, and Ti. Differences in [Na/Fe] and [Ni/Fe] are also present with a
remarkably clear correlation between these two abundance ratios. <BR />
Conclusions: The {\ldquo}high-{$\alpha$}{\rdquo} stars may be ancient disk or
bulge stars {\ldquo}heated{\rdquo} to halo kinematics by merging satellite
galaxies or they could have formed as the first stars during the
collapse of a proto-Galactic gas cloud. The kinematics of the
{\ldquo}low-{$\alpha$}{\rdquo} stars suggest that they have been accreted
from dwarf galaxies, and that some of them may originate from the
{$\omega$} Cen progenitor galaxy.

@article{Asplund2009,
	abstract = {{The solar chemical composition is an important ingredient in our
understanding of the formation, structure, and evolution of both the Sun
and our Solar System. Furthermore, it is an essential reference standard
against which the elemental contents of other astronomical objects are
compared. In this review, we evaluate the current understanding of the
solar photospheric composition. In particular, we present a
redetermination of the abundances of nearly all available elements,
using a realistic new three-dimensional (3D), time-dependent
hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere. We have carefully
considered the atomic input data and selection of spectral lines, and
accounted for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE)
whenever possible. The end result is a comprehensive and homogeneous
compilation of the solar elemental abundances. Particularly noteworthy
findings are significantly lower abundances of C, N, O, and Ne compared
to the widely used values of a decade ago. The new solar chemical
composition is supported by a high degree of internal consistency
between available abundance indicators, and by agreement with values
obtained in the Solar Neighborhood and from the most pristine
meteorites. There is, however, a stark conflict with standard models of
the solar interior according to helioseismology, a discrepancy that has
yet to find a satisfactory resolution.

	abstract = {{Our Galaxy, the Milky Way, is a benchmark for understanding disk
galaxies. It is the only galaxy whose formation history can be studied
using the full distribution of stars from faint dwarfs to supergiants.
The oldest components provide us with unique insight into how galaxies
form and evolve over billions of years. The Galaxy is a luminous
(L$_{*}$) barred spiral with a central box/peanut bulge, a
dominant disk, and a diffuse stellar halo. Based on global properties,
it falls in the sparsely populated {\ldquo}green valley{\rdquo} region of
the galaxy color-magnitude diagram. Here we review the key integrated,
structural and kinematic parameters of the Galaxy, and point to
uncertainties as well as directions for future progress. Galactic
studies will continue to play a fundamental role far into the future
because there are measurements that can only be made in the near field
and much of contemporary astrophysics depends on such observations.

problems of astrophysics. Within the broad context of hierachical
structure formation, we have only a crude picture of how galaxies like
our own came into existence. A detailed physical picture where
individual stellar populations can be associated with (tagged to)
elements of the protocloud is far beyond our current understanding.
Important clues have begun to emerge from both the Galaxy (near-field
cosmology) and the high redshift universe (far-field cosmology). Here we
focus on the fossil evidence provided by the Galaxy. Detailed studies of
the Galaxy lie at the core of understanding the complex processes
involved in baryon dissipation. This is a necessary first step toward
achieving a successful theory of galaxy formation.

@article{Jofre2019,
	abstract = {{There has been an incredibly large investment in obtaining high-
        resolution stellar spectra for determining chemical abundances
        of stars. This information is crucial to answer fundamental
        questions in astronomy by constraining the formation and
        evolution scenarios of the Milky Way as well as the stars and
        planets residing in it. We have just entered a new era, in which
        chemical abundances of FGK-type stars are being produced at
        industrial scales, and in which the observations, reduction, and
        analysis of the data are automatically performed by machines.
        Here, we review the latest human efforts to assess the accuracy
        and precision of such industrial abundances by providing
        insights into the steps and uncertainties associated with the
        process of determining stellar abundances. We also provide a
        description of current and forthcoming spectroscopic surveys,
        focusing on their reported abundances and uncertainties. This
        allows us to identify which elements and spectral lines are best
        and why. Finally, we make a brief selection of main scientific
        questions the community is aiming to answer with abundances.
        Uncertainties in abundances need to be disentangled into random
        and systematic components. Precision can be increased by
        applying differential or data-driven methods based on accurate
        data. High-resolution and signal-to-noise spectra provide

@article{McWilliam1997,
	abstract = {{The metallicity of stars in the Galaxy ranges from [Fe/H]= -4$ to +0.5
dex, and the solar iron abundance is {$\epsilon$}(Fe) = 7.51 +/- 0.01 dex.
The average values of [Fe/H] in the solar neighborhood, the halo, and
Galactic bulge are -0.2, -1.6, and -0.2 dex respectively. Detailed
abundance analysis reveals that the Galactic disk, halo, and bulge
exhibit unique abundance patterns of O, Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti and
neutron-capture elements. These signatures show that environment plays
an important role in chemical evolution and that supernovae come in many
flavors with a range of element yields. The 300-fold dispersion in heavy
element abundances of the most metal-poor stars suggests incomplete
mixing of ejecta from individual supernova, with vastly different
yields, in clouds of {approximately} 10^6 M{center dot}. The composition
of Orion association stars indicates that star-forming regions are
significantly self-enriched on time scales of 80 million years. The
rapid self-enrichment and inhomogeneous chemical evolution models are
required to match observed abundance trends and the dispersion in the
age-metallicity relation.

	abstract = {{The age of an individual star cannot be measured, only estimated through
mostly model-dependent or empirical methods, and no single method works
well for a broad range of stellar types or for a full range in age. This
review presents a summary of the available techniques for age-dating
stars and ensembles of stars, their realms of applicability, and their
strengths and weaknesses. My emphasis is on low-mass stars because they
are present from all epochs of star formation in the Galaxy and because
they present both special opportunities and problems. The ages of open
clusters are important for understanding the limitations of stellar
models and for calibrating empirical age indicators. For individual
stars, a hierarchy of quality for the available age-dating methods is
described. Although our present ability to determine the ages of even
the nearest stars is mediocre, the next few years hold great promise as
asteroseismology probes beyond stellar surfaces and starts to provide
precise interior properties of stars and as models continue to improve
when stressed by better observations.

	abstract = {{Within the Local Universe galaxies can be studied in great detail star
by star, and here we review the results of quantitative studies in
nearby dwarf galaxies. The color-magnitude diagram synthesis method is
well established as the most accurate way to determine star-formation
histories of galaxies back to the earliest times. This approach received
a large boost from the exceptional data sets that wide-field CCD imagers
on the ground and the Hubble Space Telescope could provide.
Spectroscopic studies using large ground-based telescopes such as VLT,
Magellan, Keck, and HET have allowed the determination of abundances and
kinematics for significant samples of stars in nearby dwarf galaxies.
These studies have shown how the properties of stellar populations can
vary spatially and temporally. This leads to important constraints to
theories of galaxy formation and evolution. The combination of
spectroscopy and imaging and what they have taught us about dwarf galaxy
formation and evolution is the aim of this review.

@article{Bastian2018,
	abstract = {{Globular clusters (GCs) exhibit star-to-star variations in specific
elements (e.g., He, C, N, O, Na, Al) that bear the hallmark of
high-temperature H-burning. These abundance variations can be observed
spectroscopically and also photometrically, with the appropriate choice
of filters, due to the changing of spectral features within the band
pass. This phenomenon is observed in nearly all of the ancient GCs,
although, to date, it has not been found in any massive cluster younger
than 2 Gyr. Many scenarios have been suggested to explain this
phenomenon, with most invoking multiple epochs of star formation within
the cluster; however, all have failed to reproduce various key
observations, in particular when a global view of the GC population is
taken. We review the state of current observations and outline the
successes and failures of each of the main proposed models. The
traditional idea of using the stellar ejecta from a first generation of
stars to form a second generation of stars, while conceptually
straightforward, has failed to reproduce an increasing number of
observational constraints. We conclude that the puzzle of multiple
populations remains unsolved, hence alternative theories are needed.

@article{Skrutskie2006,
	abstract = {Between 1997 June and 2001 February the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) collected 25.4 Tbytes of raw imaging data covering 99.998{\%} of the celestial sphere in the near-infrared J (1.25 $\mu$m), H (1.65 $\mu$m), and Ks (2.16 $\mu$m) bandpasses. Observations were conducted from two dedicated 1.3 m diameter telescopes located at Mount Hopkins, Arizona, and Cerro Tololo, Chile. The 7.8 s of integration time accumulated for each point on the sky and strict quality control yielded a 10 $\sigma$ point-source detection level of better than 15.8, 15.1, and 14.3 mag at the J, H, and Ks bands, respectively, for virtually the entire sky. Bright source extractions have 1 $\sigma$ photometric uncertainty of {\textless}0.03 mag and astrometric accuracy of order 100 mas. Calibration offsets between any two points in the sky are {\textless}0.02 mag. The 2MASS All-Sky Data Release includes 4.1 million compressed FITS images covering the entire sky, 471 million source extractions in a Point Source Catalog, and 1.6 million objects identified as extended in an Extended Source Catalog.},
